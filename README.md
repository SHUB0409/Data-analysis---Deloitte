# Data-analysis---Deloitte
📊 Deloitte Data Analytics & Equality Dashboard

🧩 Project Overview

This repository contains multiple data analytics and visualization tasks completed as part of the Deloitte Virtual Internship Program.
The tasks involve analyzing telemetry data, performing forensic compensation analysis, and building an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize insights and equality metrics.

🧠 Tasks Completed

Task 1: Data Analysis (Telemetry Dashboard)

Objective: Analyze the telemetry data collected by Daikibo using Tableau.

Action:

Imported telemetry data into Tableau.

Built visualizations showing factory-level and device-level performance trends.

Focused on identifying the most “unhealthy” factories and device types using bar charts and dashboards.

Outcome:


Created interactive dashboards comparing Factory and Device Type performance.

Helped detect performance gaps and operational inefficiencies across factories.

Task 2: Forensic Technology (Equality Analysis)


Objective: Conduct forensic analysis of employee compensation data to identify pay equality patterns across different factories and job roles.

Action:

Processed all compensation data and generated the Equality Table.xlsx file.

The file includes 3 key columns:

Factory

Job Role

Equality Score (integer ranging from -100 to +100, where 0 represents perfect equality).

Outcome:

Created the base dataset (Task 5 Equality Table.xlsx) used in Tableau to visualize and compare equality scores across locations.

Provided insights into compensation fairness and workforce equality across Daikibo factories.

📈 Tableau Dashboard Summary

1. Factory Unhealthiness Analysis (Sheet 1)

Visualized total unhealthy device readings by Factory.

Highlighted high-risk factories such as Daikibo-Factory-Meiyo and Daikibo-Factory-Seiko.

Helped management understand operational stress areas through visual comparisons.

2. Device Type Analysis (Sheet 2)

Analyzed the number of unhealthy readings by Device Type.

Identified devices contributing most to factory-level inefficiencies.

3. Integrated Dashboard

Combined both factory and device views into one interactive Tableau dashboard.

Allowed stakeholders to drill down by factory or device for root cause analysis.

Enabled proactive planning and maintenance scheduling to reduce unhealthy incidents.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used


Tableau Desktop – for data visualization and dashboard design.

Microsoft Excel – for forensic equality data preparation and score calculation.

Data Analysis Techniques: Aggregation, Filtering, and KPI comparison.

Data Visualization: Bar charts, dashboards, and filter-based interactivity.


🧾 Key Insights


Certain factories such as Daikibo-Factory-Meiyo and Daikibo-Factory-Seiko show higher unhealthy metrics.

Device-level analysis helps pinpoint specific problem types or models.

Equality analysis indicates varying compensation fairness across factories and job roles.


🚀 How to Use

Download the Excel dataset: Task 5 Equality Table.xlsx.

Open Tableau and connect the Excel data source.

Recreate or explore visualizations using these dimensions:

Factory → Columns

SUM(unhealthy) → Rows

Add Device Type as a secondary analysis variable.

Combine the sheets into a single interactive dashboard for factory and device comparison.


🏁 Outcome

This multi-part Deloitte project demonstrates strong skills in:

Data analysis, forensic auditing, and visualization using Tableau and Excel.

Developing equality dashboards to support ethical business practices.

Converting raw operational data into actionable business insights.
